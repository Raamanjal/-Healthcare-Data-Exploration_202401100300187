Healthcare Data Exploration

Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, visualize data distributions, and understand relationships between key health indicators such as age, blood pressure, sugar levels, and weight. EDA is a critical step in the data science process as it helps prepare the data for predictive modeling and informed decision-making.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Programming language for data analysis
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating effective visualizations

Key Features
Loading and previewing dataset
Summary statistics and basic data information
Histogram plots for Age, Blood Pressure, Sugar Level, and Weight
Correlation Matrix to identify relationships between features
Scatter Plot analysis to observe interactions between variables

Insights
The analysis helps in identifying potential risk factors and data trends, which are valuable in healthcare analytics. This foundational EDA can be further extended to build predictive models or dashboards.
